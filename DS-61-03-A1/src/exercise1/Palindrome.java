* Given a String passed as an argument , it returns a boolean indicating

*
* A palindrome is a word or phrase that reads the same backwards as forwards .
*
* Our method will not be case - sensitive , and only takes into account ASCII
* characters between 'A' and 'Z' (or 'a' and 'z '). Other characters such as
* spaces , questions marks , apostrophes , etc . are ignored .
*
* Examples of palindromes :
* * " Radar " ( case is ignored )
* * " Was it a cat I saw ?" ( Question mark ignored )
*
* @param strg
* @return True if it is a palindrome . False if it is not .
